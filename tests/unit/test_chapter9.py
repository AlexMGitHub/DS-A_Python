    How long would it take to remove the logn smallest elements from a

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. remove_min is O(n) for an unsorted priority queue, and so it would

    I assume that the purpose of this question is to point out that a sorted

    Solution:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Selection-sort operates in two phases.  In phase 1, all of the elements
    in the input sequence S are removed and added to the priority queue PQ.
    In phase 2, the remove_min() method of the priority queue is called until
    PQ is empty, and each returned value is added back to the original sequence
    such that it is ordered.

    Assuming that phase 1 is complete, then S is now empty and PQ has all of
    S's elements inserted using the element as both the key and the value.
    Selection-sort implements PQ with an unsorted list, and so the elements
    are added in unsorted order to PQ in O(n) time:

    S = ()
    PQ = {22, 15, 36, 44, 10, 3, 9, 13, 29, 25}

    Phase 2 now calls remove_min() and places each of the elements back in S.

    Illustrate the execution of the insertion-sort algorithm on the input se-

    Insertion-sort operates in two phases.  In phase 1, all of the elements

    Insertion-sort implements PQ with a sorted list, and so the elements

def test_worst_case_insertion_sort():
    """Solution to exercise R-9.9.

    Give an example of a worst-case sequence with n elements for insertion-
    sort, and show that insertion-sort runs in Î©(n^2) time on such a sequence.

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Solution:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The worst-case for insertion-sort occurs when the sequence S to be sorted
    is already sorted in reverse-order.  For example:

    S = (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)

    Insertion-sort implements the priority queue PQ with a sorted list, and so
    in phase 1 every time an element from S is added to PQ it will be sorted:

    0.  S = (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
        PQ = {}

    1.  S = (5, 4, 3, 2)
        PQ = {1}

    2.  S = (5, 4, 3)
        PQ' = {2, 1}
        PQ  = {1, 2}

    3.  S = (5, 4)
        PQ' = {3, 1, 2}
        PQ  = {1, 2, 3}

    4.  S = (5)
        PQ' = {4, 1, 2, 3}
        PQ  = {1, 2, 3, 4}

    5.  S = ()
        PQ' = {5, 1, 2, 3, 4}
        PQ  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}


    I am assuming that elements are removed from the right of S and added to
    the left of PQ.  Every time an element is added to PQ, it must be shifted
    all the way to the end of the linked list to be sorted in its proper place.
    Every item added to the linked list grows its length by one, and so each
    successive call to add() requires one more operation than the last call.

    This results in operations proportional to the sum of the first n integers,
    and so phase 1 must be Î©(n^2).  Phase 2 simply removes the items from PQ
    and adds them back into S, which can be performed in O(n) time as PQ is
    already sorted.  Because of this, phase 1 dominates the performance of
    insertion-sort, and in the case where the sequence S is sorted in reverse-
    order the running-time of insertion-sort is Î©(n^2).

def test_heap_third_smallest():
    """Solution to exercise R-9.10.

    At which positions of a heap might the third smallest key be stored?

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Solution:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A heap has the following properties:
    1. Complete binary tree property: all levels of the tree from 0 to h-1 must
       have the maximum number of nodes possible; remaining nodes at h must be
       the left-most possible nodes.
    2. Heap-order property: For every position p other than the root, the key
       stored at p is greater than or equal to the key stored at p's parent.

    Based on these two properties, we know the following:
    1. The smallest key must be at the root (level 0), and both children of the
       root must be filled if there are three or more items.
    2. The third smallest key may be either the left or right child of the root
       (level 1) as that would satisfy the heap-order property.
    3. The third smallest key can only be on level 2 if it is the child of the
       second smallest key, otherwise it would violate the heap-order property.

    So the third smallest key could be:
    1. The left or right child of the root
    2. The left or right child of the second smallest key, which in turn must
       be the left or right child of the root.

    Solution:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    1. If the priority queue is unsorted, the keys of the items could be
       stored as -1 * key.   This ensures that the largest magnitude key is
       stored at the beginning of the queue, because it will evaluate as the
       smallest negative number.

    2. If the priority queue is sorted, the max() function could simply return

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Solution:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Phase 1 of the in-place heap-sort moves left-to-right through the sequence,
    adding each element to a maximum-oriented heap.  Each new item is inserted
    into the heap at either the left-most position of a new level, or the
    right-most position of an existing level.  Each new item is up-heap bubbled
    by swapping positions with its parent node until its key is less than its
    parent's key (for a maximum-oriented heap).

    At the end of phase 1 we will have the sequence S and heap shown below:

    (2, 5, 16, 4, 10, 23, 39, 18, 26, 15)

    The caret under the value 15 indicates that the current index position
    corresponds to 15, i.e. the index is n-1 = 9.  We now begin phase 2, where
    we remove the maximum key from the heap and place it at the index n-i for
    steps i = 1, 2, ..., n.  Each time the root is removed from the heap, it is
    replaced by the last node in the heap - that is the bottom-most and right-
    most node in the heap.  The new root is then down-heap bubbled until
    its children have keys smaller than its key (for a maximum oriented heap).
    We always choose to swap nodes with the child with the larger key.

    Let T be a complete binary tree such that position p stores an element
    with key f(p), where f(p) is the level number of p (see Section 8.3.2).
    Is tree T a heap? Why or why not?

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Solution:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A complete binary tree has all levels 0 through h-1 filled with the maximum
    number nodes possible, and the remaining nodes on level h reside at the
    left-most possible positions.

    The level numbering function f(p) is calculated according to three rules:
    1. If p is root of T, f(p) = 0
    2. If p is left child of q, then f(p) = 2*f(q) + 1
    3. If p is right child of q, then f(p) = 2*f(q) + 2

    A complete binary tree storing f(p) for the keys of each node would look
    like the tree below for n = 5:

                          0
                       /    \
                      1      2
                     / \    / \
                    3   4

    A heap must satisfy two properties:
    1. The heap-order property: For every position p except for the root, the
       key stored at p is greater than or equal to the key stored at p's parent

    2. Complete binary tree property: Explained above.

    Property (2) was specified in the formulation of the question and so is
    satisfied, and property (1) is also satisfied because f(p) is calculated
    such that the child nodes will always have keys greater than their parent
    node.  Therefore tree T is a heap.

    Explain why the description of down-heap bubbling does not consider the

    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Solution:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------
    A heap that has a right child - but not a left child - violates the
    Complete Binary Tree Property which requires that the left-most possible
    nodes be filled first.
